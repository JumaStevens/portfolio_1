			p.article__subtitle Small Business
			p.article__copy Vessel is a medical dispensary located in Portland, Oregon. The challenge was to design an experience that serves their broad customer base. The solution was simplicity. Viewed on larger devices, the website employs an app aesthetic with snappy animations and a centralized navigation unit. On mobile devices, the experience is streamlined to a singular page for the graceful progression of content. The site utilizes APIs such as Google Maps and Leafly. Everything is tied together with a minimalistic aesthetic, and lightweight JavaScript interactions.
